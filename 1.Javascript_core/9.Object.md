In real life I am a object, you are also an object. Every object has property and value. Like you can see bellow a picture car. It has a name. Let the name of the car are `Ferari`. Here `name` is property and `Ferari` is value. Every car has a name. But the name of another car can be different. So, we can say if the object are same then it will have the same property. But the value can be different.

In the sense of JavaScript language `object` are quite same thing. In a Object there have property and value. Here object is one kind of variable. We can write object in like bellow:

Code:
```js
const car = {
	name: "Ferari",
	model: 500,
	color: "white"
};
```

We can access Object Properties in two way:

```js
objectName.propertyName
```

```js
objectName["propertyName"]
```

#### Example:

```js
car.name = "toyota";
```

or,

```js
car["name"] = "toyota"
```

Here you can told me why you will use the second approach. The reason is if you want to use a property name which has a space, then it will be seen as error. So, to solve this type of error we can follow the second method.

```js
var car = {
    'car name': 'toyota',
     model: 'voyota'
}
console.log(car["car name"]);
console.log(car["model"]);
```



We can also write function in the object. We call it `method`

```js
const person = {  
  firstName: "John",  
  lastName : "Doe",  
  id       : 5566,  
  fullName : function() {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
};
```

Here you can see a keyword `this`. Which denote the current object the current object.

| ---- |
| In an object method, `this` refers to the **object**. |
| Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**. |
| In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**. |
| In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`. |
| In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event. |
| Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to **any object**. |

### Object Iterate:

There has five methods for iterate an object.
- Object.entries()
- Object.keys()
- Object.values()
- Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
- for in loop

#### Object.entries()
This method was introduce in ES2017(ES8). This method returns a multi-dimentional array. The array contains an array of key -value pair of the object's properties. An example of code given bellow:

Code:
```js
const animal = {
    lion: 'v.strong',
    fowl: "thats foul!!",
    goat: 'v.stubborn'
}
const kp = Object.entries(animal)
console.log(kp)
```

Output:
```sh
[
  [ 'lion', 'v.strong' ],
  [ 'fowl', 'thats foul!!' ],
  [ 'goat', 'v.stubborn' ]
]
```

#### Object.keys:

This method returns the keys of the object in any array. An example are given bellow:
Code:
```js
const animal = {
    lion: 'v.strong',
    fowl: "thats foul!!",
    goat: 'v.stubborn'
}
const kp = Object.keys(animal)
console.log(kp)
```

Output:
```sh
[ 'lion', 'fowl', 'goat' ]
```

#### Object.values:
This method is like `object.keys` but it returns the value of the properties in an array unlike `object.keys` which returns the keys of the properties.

Code:
```js
const animal = {
    lion: 'v.strong',
    fowl: "thats foul!!",
    goat: 'v.stubborn'
}
Object.defineProperty(animal, 'lamb', {
    value: 'v.meek',
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    writable: true
})
const kp = Object.values(animal)
console.log(kp)
```

Output:
```sh
[ 'v.strong', 'thats foul!!', 'v.stubborn', 'v.meek' ]
```

#### Object.getOwnPropertyNames:
This method returns all property of an object. An example are given bellow:

Code:
```js
const animal = {
    lion: 'v.strong',
    fowl: "thats foul!!",
    goat: 'v.stubborn'
}
/*
configurable: true: The property can be modified or deleted later.
enumerable: true: The property will be included in object enumeration methods like `for...in` loops and `Object.keys()`.
writable: true: The property's value can be changed directly.
*/

Object.defineProperty(animal, 'lamb', {
    value: 'v.meek',
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    writable: true
})
const kp = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(animal)
console.log(kp)
```

This method also traverse the prototype chain to return the property names of the object's sub-class and it also returns non-enumerabel properties of an object.

#### For in loop:

One of the `for` loop statements in javascript. This `for in` statement can be used to iterate through objects. It only collects enumerable properties.

Code:
```js
const animal = {
    lion: 'v.strong',
    fowl: "thats foul!!",
    goat: 'v.stubborn'
}
for (let prop in animal) {
    console.log(`key: ${prop} : value: ${animal[prop]}`)
}
```

Output:
```sh
key: lion : value: v.strong
key: fowl : value: thats foul!!
key: goat : value: v.stubborn
```
