In real life I am a object, you are also an object. Every object has property and value. Like you can see bellow a picture car. It has a name. Let the name of the car are `Ferari`. Here `name` is property and `Ferari` is value. Every car has a name. But the name of another car can be different. So, we can say if the object are same then it will have the same property. But the value can be different.

In the sense of JavaScript language `object` are quite same thing. In a Object there have property and value. Here object is one kind of variable. We can write object in like bellow:

Code:
```js
const car = {
	name: "Ferari",
	model: 500,
	color: "white"
};
```

We can access Object Properties in two way:

```js
objectName.propertyName
```

```js
objectName["propertyName"]
```

#### Example:

```js
car.name = "toyota";
```

or,

```js
car["name"] = "toyota"
```

Here you can told me why you will use the second approach. The reason is if you want to use a property name which has a space, then it will be seen as error. So, to solve this type of error we can follow the second method.

```js
var car = {
    'car name': 'toyota',
     model: 'voyota'
}
console.log(car["car name"]);
console.log(car["model"]);
```



We can also write function in the object. We call it `method`

```js
const person = {  
  firstName: "John",  
  lastName : "Doe",  
  id       : 5566,  
  fullName : function() {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
};
```

Here you can see a keyword `this`. Which denote the current object the current object.

| ---- |
| In an object method, `this` refers to the **object**. |
| Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**. |
| In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**. |
| In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`. |
| In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event. |
| Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to **any object**. |
