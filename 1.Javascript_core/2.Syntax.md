JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how a Javascript programs are constructed. As in another programming language we print `Hello World!` message. Now here I write program to print `Hello world!` message:

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```

Here you can see the semi clone at last. This is not mandetory. But we should use it for best practice. Further if we want to write multiple statement in one line we must use the semi-clone after the statement.
