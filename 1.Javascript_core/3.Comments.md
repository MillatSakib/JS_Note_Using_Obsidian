Comments are use in the code make more readable.  There has two method to define comment:
- Single Line Comments
- Multiple Line Comments

**`Single Line Comments`**: The single line comments are start with `//` sign. And as it is single line comment we don't have to add additional thing after the comment. An Example are given bellow:

```js
//this is single line comment
console.log("In this code I add a single line commnet");
```

**`Multi-Line Comments`**: Multi-line comments are start with `/*` and end with `*/`.  Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by  JavaScript. If we have mult-line in the comment section then we can use the `Multi-line`  comment. An example are given bellow:

```js
/*
Hey Mansina how are you.

I know you don't ask me how am I!

*/


console.log("This is the example of Multi-line comments");
```
