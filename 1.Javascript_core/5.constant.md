The keyword `const` was introduce in `Es6`. The constant work like as variable. Only the difference between variable and constant are we can change or update the data of variable in anytime. But in constant we can only assign the value for first time, we can't update the value of constant. An example are given bellow:

Code:
```js
const variable = 10;
console.log(variable);
```

Output: 
```sh
10
```

But in the case of declaring constant object or array it work quite different way. When you learn about the concept of object or array then you know it works with refence. That's why if we declare the constant object then it take constant reference. That's why we can't assign another object or array into constant array. But we can update the value of constant array or constant object. An example are given bellow:

Code:
```js
const variable = [5, 10, 15];
console.log(variable);
variable[1] = 30;
console.log(variable);
```

Output:
```sh
[ 5, 10, 15 ]
[ 5, 30, 15 ]
```

Here you can see that we can update the value of constant array.
