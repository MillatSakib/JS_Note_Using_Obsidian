Now JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. But it called toy language when it was developed. JavaScript are mostly use in web programming. But we can also develop Mobile software using JavaScript. 

Brendan Eich develop JavaScript within 10days to add interactivity in browser. In the first age of JavaScript it was use manipulating DOM. But after releasing `Nodejs` it is a most powerful programming language. We can use JavaScript in Frontend & Backend. 

We may listen the word `ES5` or `ES6`. The full meaning of `ES` Is `Ecma Script`. The Full form form of `Ecma` is `European Computer Manufacturers Association`. At first release the JavaScript was released as `livescript`. Though the name it was `Mocha` when it was in development process . But in 1996 the name changed into JavaScript. The first version of `Ecma script` was released in 1997 and the name was `ES1`. And then it was developed day by day. After releasing `ES5` JavaScript becomes very powerful. And then 2015 the `Ecma International` take decision that they will update the language yearly. But in this time the `ES6` was released. This is why the name `ES6` changed into `ES2015`. And after this year the version are naming using year name.
