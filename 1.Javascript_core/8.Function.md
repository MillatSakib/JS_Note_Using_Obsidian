A function is a block of code which perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when we invoke it. In JavaScript we define a function using function keyword. An example of function are given bellow:

Code:
```js
function myFunction(a, b){      //here we define a function
  return a*b;
}

console.log(myFunction(5, 6));    //here we invoke function
```

Here we can see we throw value when we call function and when we define a function we take two value. That's are call Argument and Parameter respectively. 

#### Return Statement:

When JavaScript reaches a `return statement` then the function stop execution.

#### Scope:
We will learn about scope later. But remind that we can make a new scope using function.

We can make function in different way. I will tell now about them.

### `Function Declaration`

The code which I write before this type of function are called `function declaration`. Some key sentence about `function declaration` are given bellow:

- Defined using the `function` keyword followed by a name and parentheses.
- Hoisted, meaning they can be called before their declaration in the code.
- Suitable for functions that need to be available throughout the script.

Example:
```js
function greet(name){
  console.log("Hello, "+ name + "!");
}

greet("Sakib");
```


### `Function Expression`:

If I assign a function into a variable then it will call `function expression`. Some key sentence about `function expression` are given bellow:

- Assigned to a variable using the `=` operator.
- Not hoisted, so they must be defined before being called.
- More flexible, as they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, or used immediately.
- Here we declare a function anonymously. That's why we don't have to think about function name.

```js
const greet = function(name) {
	return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Sakib"));
```

### `Arrow Function`:

`Arrow Function` is a shorthand of function expression. Some key sentence about `Arrow Function` are given bellow:

- Introduced in ES6, using `=>` for a concise syntax.
- Implicit `return` for single-line expressions.
- If we are pass only one parameter then no need to use `first bracket`.
- Well-suited for callback functions.

Example for one parameter:
```js
const mulByThree = a => a * 3;
console.log(mulByThree(3, 4));
```

Example for more than one parameter:
```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(3, 4));
```

### `Constructor Function`:

In JavaScript, a function constructor is a unique type of function specifically designed to create and initialize objects. It's a fundamental tool for object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Function constructors play a vital role in JavaScript's object-oriented capabilities, empowering you to create custom object types with tailored structures and behaviors. When we declare a `Constructor Function` the first charecter of it are uppercase.

**Here's a breakdown of its key features:**

- **Blueprint for Objects:** Think of a function constructor as a template or blueprint that defines the initial structure and properties of objects you want to create.
- **Invocation with `new`:** To create an object using a function constructor, you invoke it with the `new` keyword, like this: `new ConstructorName()`.
- **`this` Keyword:** Inside a function constructor, the `this` keyword refers to the newly created object being constructed. It's used to assign values to the object's properties.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Custom object types with specific properties and behaviors.
- Encapsulating data and logic within objects.
- Establishing inheritance hierarchies.
- Reusable object blueprints for different parts of your application.

```js
// Function constructor for creating Person objects
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
// Create a new Person object
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(person1); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 30 }

```

### `IFFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expression

- Function expressions that are executed immediately after being defined.
- Used to create private variables or namespaces.
Example:
```js
(function() {
  const privateVariable = "secret";
  console.log(privateVariable); // Output: secret
})();
```

### `Recursion`
 If a function are called themselves then it called Recursion. Recursion are usually used to traversal or factorial Calculation. An example are given bellow:
 ```js
 function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

There has also another kind of function like `Generator Function`, `Async Generator Function`, `Async Await function` `Methods` etc. We will learn about them later.
