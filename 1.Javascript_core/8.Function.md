A function is a block of code which perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when we invoke it. In JavaScript we define a function using function keyword. An example of function are given bellow:

Code:
```js
function myFunction(a, b){      //here we define a function
  return a*b;
}

console.log(myFunction(5, 6));    //here we invoke function
```

Here we can see we throw value when we call function and when we define a function we take two value. That's are call Argument and Parameter respectively. 

#### Return Statement:

When JavaScript reaches a `return statement` then the function stop execution.

#### Scope:
We will learn about scope later. But remind that we can make a new scope using function.
